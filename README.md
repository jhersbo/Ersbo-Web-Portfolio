## Jack Ersbo's Portfolio Site ##

### About ###
This serves as my personal portfolio site. This will continue to be added to as I grow as a developer. 
### Tech Utilized ###

This site is built with TypeScript and React.js.

I utilize the Framer Motion library (found [here](https://www.framer.com/motion/)) to implement subtle animations on some of the components. The library supports all of the standard HTML5 components and enables custom props to govern the animations.
